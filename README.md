# TGMUtils

This started out as part of an unfinished project for reading and editing 
rFactor2 TGM tire defintions. The project itself is on ice, but this TGM parser 
is one of the results worth releasing and maybe somebody can use to make something
with the TGM tire data.

TGM files in rFactor2 contain the definition of how tires behave within the 
racing simulation. The tire model is rather complex and a tool for editing this
is certainly worth the effort for many modders in the community.

## Project structure

Simple, tests contains jUnit tests and src the actual bit of source code.
